# DONATFLIX

During the study I was developing a term project, which should be to implement an application on the theme of movies using the following technologies: Room, Firebase, Retrofit, DI (Koin), Multithreading, MVVM. The main screen features a movie search, a slidePager with popular movie trailers that scrolls automatically, and two lists of movies by genre. Clicking on a movie in the slidePager will open a youtube video with that movie. When you select a movie in the search, or in one of the lists, detailed information about the particular movie will open.
